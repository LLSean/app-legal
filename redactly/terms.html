    <h1>Redactly — Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>
</div>

<div class="content">

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>By downloading or using Redactly, you agree to be bound by these terms. Please read them carefully before using the App.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Redactly application ("the App") developed by Sean ("we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Redactly is a privacy tool that helps users redact sensitive information from photos and screenshots. The App uses on-device machine learning to detect and obscure personal data such as phone numbers, email addresses, names, physical addresses, and faces.</p>
    <p>All processing occurs entirely on your device. We do not access, collect, or store your images or the data detected within them.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using Redactly, you represent that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you should review these Terms with a parent or guardian.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms</li>
        <li>Not use the App to facilitate fraud, deception, or any illegal activity</li>
        <li>Not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
        <li>Not redistribute, sublicense, or resell the App or any part thereof</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>Redactly offers a free tier with limited daily usage, as well as optional paid subscriptions ("Redactly Pro") that unlock additional features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions are billed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions</li>
        <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase</li>
        <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your device's Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prices are subject to change. We will notify users of any price changes in accordance with Apple's policies. Refunds are handled exclusively by Apple in accordance with their refund policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Free Trial</h2>
    <p>We may offer free trial periods for Redactly Pro. If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the advertised price. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited upon purchasing a subscription.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, features, and functionality of the App — including but not limited to its design, code, graphics, and trademarks — are owned by us and are protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>You retain full ownership of any images you process using the App. We claim no rights to your content.</p>

    <h2>8. Privacy & Analytics</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is fundamental to Redactly. Our data practices are described in our <a href="https://llsean.github.io/app-legal/redactly/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>
    <p>The App uses Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregate usage data (such as feature usage and screen views) to help us improve the experience. This data is not linked to your identity and does not include any content from your photos. For details, please review our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App will detect all sensitive information in every image</li>
        <li>Detection results will be 100% accurate in all circumstances</li>
        <li>The App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You acknowledge that no automated detection system is perfect. You are responsible for reviewing redacted images before sharing them.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our affiliates from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that we determine violates these Terms or is harmful to other users or us.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (such as Limitation of Liability and Indemnification) will remain in effect.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the developer resides, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>
